 *  \par Velocity Profile with non zero initial velocities
 *   This file extends the VelocityProfile abstract class, generating velocity
 *   profiles which are time optimal (subjected to maximum accelerations and
 *   velocities) and may have initial velocities different from zero.
 *   It calculates the coefficients of a second-order polynomial for each
 *   part of the trajectory (piece-wise, non-symmetric trapezoid velocity
 *   profile)
 *   Then it provides functions to obtain the necessary
 *   position/velocity/acceleration of the trajectory at a certain instant.
 *
 *   \par Creating a Velocity Profile
 *   To create the Velocity Profile, two steps must be accomplished:
 *    * The class constructor should be instantiated
 *    * The SetProfile function should be called with any the provided
 *      interfaces
 *
 *   \par Subprofiles
 *   Each profile consists of one or more subprofiles. A subprofile is each of
 *   the different parts the trajectory is divided in, but these are
 *   transparent to the user
